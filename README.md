Class project for Game Development Class

Students were tasked with creating a "Vertical Slice" of a game using the unity engine. 
No restrictions on which assets could be used within the game. 

For this project I chose to create a Third Person 3d game. Writing the scripts for character movement, animations, and interaction with the world. Designing the world and integrating the UI, game event system.
